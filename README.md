# Multiclass Fish Image Classification

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Deep Learning–based image classification system** that can identify different species of fish from images. The solution uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Transfer Learning with pre-trained models** to improve classification accuracy.

The trained model is deployed using a **Streamlit web application** that allows users to upload a fish image and get the predicted fish category with a confidence score.

# Problem Statement

Fish species classification is an important task in **marine biology, fisheries management, and the seafood industry**. Manual identification of fish species can be time-consuming and error-prone.

The goal of this project is to develop an **automated system that classifies fish images into multiple categories using deep learning techniques**.

# Project Workflow

## Data Collection

The dataset contains images of different fish species organized into folders where each folder represents a class.

Example structure:

```
data/
 ├── train/
 ├── test/
 └── val/
```

---

## Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were applied:

* Resize images to **224 × 224**
* Normalize pixel values
* Convert images to RGB format

---

## Data Augmentation

To improve model generalization and prevent overfitting:

* Random rotation
* Random zoom
* Horizontal flipping

---

## Model Development

Two approaches were used:

### Baseline Model

A **CNN model built from scratch**.

### Transfer Learning Models

Five pre-trained models were used:

* VGG16
* ResNet50
* MobileNet
* InceptionV3
* EfficientNetB0

Pre-trained models were initialized with **ImageNet weights** and fine-tuned on the fish dataset.

---

## Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* Confusion Matrix

Training history (accuracy and loss) was also visualized to analyze model performance.

---

## Model Selection

The model with the **highest validation accuracy** was selected as the final model and saved as a `.h5` file.

```
best_model.h5
```

---

# Streamlit Deployment

A **Streamlit web application** was built to allow users to:

* Upload a fish image
* Predict fish species
* Display prediction confidence

Run the application using:

```
streamlit run app.py
```
